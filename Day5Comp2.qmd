## Some logical operators

-    == (does this match?)

-   != (do these not match?)

-   \>, \<, \>=, \<=

-   & (and), \| (or)

```{r}
# does 4 match 5, no
4 == 5

# does 4 match 4, yes
4 == 4

# does 4 not match 5, yes
4 != 5

# does 4 match "4", yes
4 == "4"

#with assigned variables:
cat <- 10
dog <- 7

cat>dog

# Is dog greater than cat, OR is cat less than 20?

dog>cat | cat<20
#one or both can be true for an OR statement to return TRUE

# Is dog <cat AND cat = 10?
dog<cat & cat == 10

dog<cat & cat>2 & 4 >= dog
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg))+
  geom_point(aes(size = mpg, color = wt))+
  labs(x = "Car Weight (1000 pounds", y = "Gas Mileage (MPG)", title = "Car weight efficiency relationship")
```
